# PodTeksT — VIRAL FEATURE CONCEPTS (Agent 2: Psychology & Relationship Expert)

7 concepts tapping into the deepest human curiosity about relationships and communication.

---

## 1. "Kto Kogo Bardziej?" (Who Loves More?)

**One-line pitch:** A cold, mathematical answer to the question every couple whispers at 3 AM but never asks out loud.

**Mechanism:** Composite asymmetry index built from 12+ quantitative signals: who texts first more often, who writes longer messages, who responds faster, who uses more affectionate language, who initiates plans, who sends more messages after silence, who double-texts, who uses more emoji/reactions, whose messages get shorter over time vs longer. Produces a single brutal ratio like "73:27" with a visual tug-of-war bar. Tracks this ratio over time to show if it was always this way or if it shifted.

**Psychological hook:** This is THE question. Every person in every relationship has a private theory about this. Seeing it quantified with actual data from your own messages is irresistible and terrifying. It validates the insecurity people carry silently.

**Share/debate trigger:** "I showed my partner our ratio and they got MAD." People will argue endlessly about whether the metrics actually measure love vs. communication style vs. anxiety. Partners will screenshot their ratios and post them. The discourse writes itself: "A 60:40 is healthy, 80:20 is a situationship."

## 2. "Maska vs. Prawda" (Mask vs. Truth) — The Persona Gap Report

**One-line pitch:** The measurable distance between who you PERFORM as in texts and who the data says you actually are.

**Mechanism:** Cross-reference self-perception signals (how the person presents: "I'm so chill," "I don't care," "whatever you want") against behavioral data (they actually triple-text, respond in 11 seconds, write paragraphs, use anxious language patterns). Build a "Persona Gap Score" (0-100) across 5 dimensions: emotional availability (claimed vs. actual), decisiveness (claimed vs. actual), independence (claimed vs. actual), conflict style (claimed avoidant vs. actually aggressive), investment level (claimed casual vs. actually obsessive). Show direct quote evidence: "You said 'I'm easy-going' but your data shows you initiated 83% of scheduling conversations."

**Psychological hook:** People are OBSESSED with authenticity and terrified of being perceived as fake. This feature says: "Here is the exact gap between the version of you that you perform and the version that your behavior reveals." It's a mirror that doesn't lie.

**Share/debate trigger:** "My Persona Gap is 78 and I feel ATTACKED." People will debate whether having a high gap makes you manipulative or just anxious. Avoidant-attachment people will get exposed hardest. The discourse around "performing chill" in dating culture is already massive on TikTok — this quantifies it.

## 3. "Punkt Bez Powrotu" (Point of No Return) — Relationship Decay Timeline

**One-line pitch:** The exact date your relationship started dying, pinpointed to the week, with the receipts.

**Mechanism:** Longitudinal analysis of 8+ decay signals: average response time trend, message length trend, conversation initiation ratio shift, emoji/reaction frequency drop, late-night messaging decline, "administrative only" conversation ratio increase, first-text-of-day delay growth, weekend vs. weekday engagement shift. Algorithm identifies the inflection point where 3+ signals simultaneously shift negative. Displays a timeline with the critical week highlighted and annotated: "Week of March 12: Response times increased 340%, affectionate language dropped 67%, you stopped texting first entirely."

**Psychological hook:** Humans are haunted by "when did it go wrong?" After breakups, people replay events obsessively. This gives them a definitive answer with data. For current relationships, it is either reassuring ("no decay detected") or a wake-up call that is more powerful than any therapist's gentle suggestion.

**Share/debate trigger:** "According to PodTeksT, my relationship died on September 14th. That's the week he went to that wedding." People will connect the date to real events and create narrative. Ex-couples will compare their reports and argue about whose fault it was. The concept of a mathematically identifiable "death date" for a relationship is inherently viral.

## 4. "Emocjonalny Rachunek" (Emotional Invoice) — Who Owes Who?

**One-line pitch:** An itemized invoice of the emotional labor each person performed, priced in effort and never acknowledged.

**Mechanism:** Track and categorize emotional labor signals: who manages logistics (plans, reminders, scheduling language), who does repair after conflict (first to apologize, first to break silence), who performs emotional check-ins ("how are you," "how was your day"), who manages the other person's emotions (reassurance, validation, de-escalation patterns), who carries conversational burden (topic initiation, question-asking ratio), who remembers things (referencing past conversations, callbacks). Present as a literal styled invoice: "Emotional Labor Invoice — January 2024. Conflict repair x 7 @ high effort = Partner A. Schedule management x 23 @ medium effort = Partner A. TOTAL IMBALANCE: Partner A performed 74% of emotional labor."

**Psychological hook:** Emotional labor discourse is MASSIVE, especially among women. Everyone feels they do more. This quantifies it with their actual messages. It names the invisible work. For the person carrying the load, it is deeply validating. For the other person, it is a confrontation they cannot argue with because the evidence is their own words.

**Share/debate trigger:** "I literally have an INVOICE proving I carried this relationship." The gender dynamics discourse alone will fuel weeks of content. People will argue about what counts as emotional labor. Partners will dispute the categories. Therapists will weigh in. It touches the deepest resentment in long-term relationships.

## 5. "Twoj Typ Na Powtorce" (Your Type On Repeat) — Pattern Recidivism Report

**One-line pitch:** Upload multiple conversations and discover you have been dating the same person in different bodies.

**Mechanism:** Requires 2+ conversation uploads. Cross-analyze the USER's behavior patterns across relationships and the PARTNER archetypes they attract. For the user: Do you always become the anxious one? Do you always over-invest in month 2? Do your messages always get shorter by month 6? For partners: Do they all have the same response time pattern? Same conflict avoidance? Same love-bombing-then-withdrawal arc? Produce a "Recidivism Score" (0-100) and a "Your Type" archetype: "You consistently choose emotionally unavailable partners who front-load affection. Your last 3 conversations show the same arc: intense first 8 weeks, plateau, withdrawal by partner, anxiety spiral by you."

**Psychological hook:** "Insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results." People suspect they have a type but seeing the PATTERN mapped across multiple relationships with data is devastating and clarifying. It bypasses all the narratives people tell themselves about why each relationship was "different."

**Share/debate trigger:** "My Recidivism Score is 91. I am literally dating the same avoidant person on a loop." People will share their "type" profiles. Friends will tag each other. The "why do I keep choosing the same person" discourse is universal. It also creates a natural upsell — people will upload MORE conversations to see if the pattern holds.

## 6. "Co Naprawde Mowisz Gdy Mowisz Dobranoc" (What You Really Say When You Say Goodnight) — Micro-Ritual Decoder

**One-line pitch:** Your "goodnight" texts reveal more about your relationship than any conversation you have ever had.

**Mechanism:** Isolate and analyze micro-rituals: goodnight/goodmorning messages, greetings, farewells, "I love you" patterns, pet name usage. Track: Who says it first? Has the language degraded (from "Dobranoc kochanie, snij o mnie" to "noc")? What is the response time to "I love you"? Are there gaps where the ritual disappears? Does one person always initiate the ritual? Map the evolution: "Month 1: 'Kocham Cie, dobranoc skarbie' (mutual, <2 min response). Month 8: 'Noc' (one-sided, 47 min average response, skipped 12 days in row)." The degradation of micro-rituals is one of the strongest predictors of relationship decline in actual research.

**Psychological hook:** People pour meaning into these tiny exchanges. A late "goodnight" text can ruin someone's entire night. This feature says: the small things ARE the big things, and here is the proof. It validates the person who noticed the shift and was told they were "overreacting."

**Share/debate trigger:** "My partner went from 'sweet dreams beautiful' to 'night' in 4 months and THIS GRAPH SHOWS IT." People will screenshot the degradation timelines. The "am I overthinking or is this a sign" debate is the #1 relationship anxiety discourse. This gives data-backed answers.

## 7. "Widmo" (The Specter) — Ghost Risk Probability Engine

**One-line pitch:** A real-time probability score predicting whether you are about to get ghosted, updated with every message.

**Mechanism:** Machine-learning-style scoring (rule-based, no actual ML needed) across 15+ pre-ghost signals documented in communication research: response time acceleration (getting slower), message length compression, emoji reduction, question-asking decline, topic depth shallowing ("haha" and "nice" increasing), initiative ratio collapse (you text first 90%+), read-receipt-to-response gap widening, weekend silence pattern, "busy" excuse frequency increase, future-reference language disappearing (no more "we should," "next week," "when you"). Produce a "Ghost Probability: 73%" with a trend line. Update the score based on the most recent 2 weeks vs. the baseline.

**Psychological hook:** Ghosting is the defining anxiety of modern dating. The not-knowing is worse than the rejection. People would PAY for a warning system. This turns their deepest dating anxiety into a quantifiable, trackable metric. Even if the score is low ("Ghost Risk: 8%"), the reassurance is valuable.

**Share/debate trigger:** "PodTeksT gave my situationship a 89% ghost probability on Tuesday. He disappeared on Thursday." Prediction stories will go viral. People will debate the accuracy. Some will try to "lower their score" by changing behavior. Others will screenshot a rising ghost probability and send it directly to the person: "explain this." The intersection of data and dating anxiety is pure viral fuel.

## Implementation Priority Recommendation

If building one of these first, **"Kto Kogo Bardziej?"** (Who Loves More?) is the strongest candidate because:

- It requires only quantitative data already computed (no new AI passes needed)
- It produces a single, shareable number (the ratio)
- It is universally relatable — every single person in a relationship has wondered this
- It is inherently two-sided, meaning both people will want to see it, doubling your user acquisition
- The share format is dead simple: a tug-of-war bar with two names and a ratio

**"Punkt Bez Powrotu"** (Point of No Return) is second because the "death date" concept is a uniquely powerful hook that no other app provides, and it also relies primarily on existing quantitative trend data.
