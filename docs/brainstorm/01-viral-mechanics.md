# PodTeksT — VIRAL FEATURE CONCEPTS (Agent 1: Viral Mechanics Expert)

Here are 7 never-before-seen feature concepts, each designed to exploit a different viral mechanic using real conversation data.

---

## 1. "Scenariusz Rozstania" (Breakup Script)

**One-line pitch:** AI writes the exact movie scene of how your relationship will end — with dialogue, stage directions, and a genre.

**How it works:** Using the full conversation arc (early enthusiasm decay, response time drift, topic avoidance patterns, emotional labor imbalance from Pass 2, attachment styles from Pass 3), Gemini writes a 1-page screenplay-format "breakup scene" — complete with a genre tag (Thriller, Dark Comedy, French Arthouse, Bollywood Musical). It picks the most likely trigger, the person who initiates, the setting, and even predicts the final text message word-for-word based on each person's writing style. The output is a shareable card styled like a screenplay page with a genre poster.

**Why it goes viral:** People are OBSESSED with predictions about their relationships. The genre assignment alone sparks debate ("Why did it say our breakup is a HORROR MOVIE?!"). Couples will share it as a joke, exes will share it as vindication, singles will run their old chats through it for closure content. The screenplay format is instantly memeable — people will read them aloud on TikTok. The controversy engine is built in: "Is your AI breakup script accurate?" becomes the debate.

**Data used:** Response time trends over time, conversation volume decay curves, emotional sentiment trajectory, attachment styles (anxious/avoidant dynamics), conflict patterns from Pass 2, individual writing style from Pass 3, topic frequency shifts, ghosting probability score.

## 2. "Twoj Chat w Sadzie" (Your Chat on Trial)

**One-line pitch:** An AI courtroom trial where your conversation is evidence — complete with prosecution, defense, judge's verdict, and a sentence.

**How it works:** The conversation is put "on trial" for a specific charge automatically determined from the data (e.g., "Emotional Negligence in the First Degree," "Premeditated Breadcrumbing," "Aggravated Love Bombing"). Gemini generates a full mini-trial: the Prosecution cites real quotes and patterns as evidence, the Defense argues mitigating circumstances (context, timing, reciprocity metrics), and a Judge delivers a verdict with a "sentence" (e.g., "6 months of therapy," "Lifetime ban from 'haha' reactions," "Community service: actually replying within 2 hours"). Each person gets a mugshot-style card with their charge and verdict.

**Why it goes viral:** The legal framing makes serious relationship dynamics feel safe to share — it is "just a joke" but the charges hit close to home. People will argue about whether the verdict was fair. The mugshot card format is perfect for Instagram Stories. Friend groups will "put all their chats on trial" in a chain. The specific charges become inside jokes and identity markers ("I got convicted of Serial Ghosting, what did you get?").

**Data used:** Red/green flags from Pass 4, power balance dynamics from Pass 2, specific quote evidence from all passes, response time patterns (ghosting evidence), double-texting frequency, emotional labor metrics, conversation initiation ratio, conflict resolution patterns.

## 3. "Rozmowa DNA" (Conversation DNA)

**One-line pitch:** Your chat has a unique genetic code — a visual double helix where every gene is a real conversation trait, and you can see what "offspring" two chats would produce.

**How it works:** Every measurable conversation trait (response time, emoji density, message length, time-of-day preference, conflict style, humor frequency, affection ratio, etc.) is mapped to a "gene" on a visual DNA strand. Each person in the conversation gets one strand of the helix, color-coded blue/purple. Dominant and recessive traits are identified. The shareable card is a beautiful double-helix visualization with trait labels. The killer feature: you can "breed" two different conversation DNAs together (e.g., your chat with your ex vs. your chat with your best friend) to see what the "offspring conversation" would look like — a predicted hybrid communication style.

**Why it goes viral:** The DNA visual is immediately striking and shareable — it looks like nothing else in any app. The "breeding" mechanic creates a second viral loop because people need to analyze TWO conversations to use it, doubling engagement. People will compare their DNA strands ("My conversation DNA with him is 73% compatible with my DNA with her"). The biological metaphor makes abstract communication patterns feel tangible and personal. Science-coded aesthetics perform extremely well on social media.

**Data used:** All 60+ quantitative metrics mapped to individual "genes," Big Five traits, attachment styles, emoji usage patterns, temporal patterns (chronotype matching), vocabulary complexity, conversation initiation ratio, response time distributions, topic diversity scores.

## 4. "Czat Tinder Profil" (Chat-Generated Dating Profile)

**One-line pitch:** AI builds the brutally honest dating profile each person SHOULD have, based entirely on how they actually communicate — not how they think they do.

**How it works:** Using the full psychological profile (Big Five, attachment style, love languages, communication patterns), plus hard behavioral data (average response time, ghosting frequency, double-text rate, emoji vocabulary, peak activity hours, conflict avoidance score), Gemini generates a mock dating app profile for each person in the conversation. It includes: a "bio" written in their actual texting style, their real "stats" presented like a dating profile (e.g., "Response time: 47min avg, Emoji game: 3/10, Will double-text: 94% chance"), a list of "honest prompts" (like Hinge prompts but brutally real: "My love language is... leaving you on read for 3 hours then sending a meme"), and a "Match%" with specific personality types. Output is a phone-mockup card that looks like a real dating app screen.

**Why it goes viral:** Everyone wants to know what their "real" dating profile would say. The brutal honesty is the hook — it is funny because it is true. People in relationships will make their partner's profile and share it. Singles will share their own as self-deprecating humor. The dating-app visual format is universally recognizable. The "honest prompts" section alone will generate TikTok content for weeks. Couples will argue about accuracy. The format invites comparison: "Post your Chat Tinder Profile."

**Data used:** Writing style analysis, average response times, ghosting probability, double-texting patterns, emoji usage profile, message length patterns, conversation initiation ratio, Big Five personality, attachment style, love languages, peak activity times, conflict style, humor frequency, affection patterns.

## 5. "Wiadomosc z Przyszlosci" (Message from the Future)

**One-line pitch:** AI predicts the exact message each person will send in 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years — based on how their communication style is evolving.

**How it works:** The system analyzes how each person's texting behavior has changed over the course of the conversation: Are messages getting shorter? Is emoji usage increasing or decreasing? Are response times drifting? Is vocabulary shifting? Is the emotional tone trending warmer or colder? Then Gemini extrapolates these trajectories and generates three "future messages" per person — one from 1 year out, 5 years, and 10 years — written in the predicted evolved style of that person. The card shows a fake iMessage/WhatsApp thread with timestamps in the future and these predicted messages, looking eerily like a real conversation.

**Why it goes viral:** Prediction content is inherently shareable because everyone has an opinion on whether it is right or wrong. The fake-screenshot format is instantly recognizable and will be reposted as-is. The 10-year prediction is where it gets wild — will you still be talking? Will one person's messages be one-word answers? The emotional trajectory makes it hit hard: seeing "your future self" gradually becoming distant or warmer is viscerally affecting. People will screenshot and say "the AI predicted we'd stop talking and it was RIGHT." Exes running old chats through it is guaranteed engagement.

**Data used:** Temporal trend analysis across all metrics (message length over time, response time drift, emoji frequency changes, vocabulary evolution, conversation volume trajectory), sentiment analysis trends, topic shift patterns, conversation initiation ratio changes, attachment style indicators over time.

## 6. "Pogrzeb Rozmowy" (Conversation Funeral)

**One-line pitch:** A full eulogy, obituary, and tombstone for your dying or dead conversation — with cause of death, time of death, and mourners.

**How it works:** For conversations that show decline (reduced frequency, shorter messages, longer gaps, fewer emojis, topic exhaustion), the system generates a complete "funeral service." This includes: a Death Certificate (cause of death: "Chronic Emotional Unavailability," time of death: the exact date the conversation pattern broke), an Obituary (celebrating the conversation's best moments with real quotes from the golden era), a Eulogy (AI-written speech about what the conversation meant and what killed it), a Tombstone card (with dates, epitaph, and a "Rest in Read Receipts" footer), and a list of "Mourners" (the topics, inside jokes, and patterns that died with the conversation). For still-active conversations, it generates a "Life Expectancy" prognosis instead.

**Why it goes viral:** Dark humor about dead conversations is universally relatable — everyone has a chat they stopped responding to. The tombstone card is peak meme format. The "cause of death" becomes a shareable identity moment ("My conversation died of Mutual Disinterest, what killed yours?"). The obituary section, which highlights real golden-era quotes, adds genuine emotional weight that makes people actually feel something — and emotional content gets shared more. The "Life Expectancy" for active conversations adds urgency and FOMO. People will run every old chat through it. TikTok creators will film themselves reading the eulogy aloud.

**Data used:** Conversation volume over time (decay curves), message frequency trends, response time degradation, emoji usage decline, topic repetition/exhaustion metrics, last message analysis, gap analysis (longest silences), conversation initiation ratio shifts, sentiment trajectory, the "golden era" peak metrics for contrast.

## 7. "Twoje NPC Dialogi" (Your NPC Dialogues)

**One-line pitch:** AI turns each person into a video game NPC with a dialogue tree, quest log, catchphrases, and a stat sheet — based on their actual texting patterns.

**How it works:** Each person in the conversation is reimagined as an NPC (Non-Player Character) from an RPG. The system generates: an NPC Class (e.g., "Chaos Bard," "Passive-Aggressive Healer," "Emotionally Unavailable Tank") based on Big Five + communication role, a Stat Sheet (CHR based on emoji charm, INT based on vocabulary, DEX based on response speed, WIS based on conflict resolution, STR based on conversation dominance), a Dialogue Tree showing their 3-4 most common conversation patterns as branching options (with real catchphrases), a Quest Log of "quests they give you" (recurring requests, topics they always bring up), and a Shop Inventory of "items they sell" (compliments, memes, emotional support, unsolicited advice — with prices reflecting how rare each is). The card looks like an actual RPG character screen.

**Why it goes viral:** NPC content is MASSIVE on TikTok and Instagram — the NPC streaming trend proved people love seeing human behavior framed as game mechanics. The class assignment alone is a viral identity moment ("I'm a Chaos Bard, what are you?"). The dialogue tree using real catchphrases is hilarious because people will recognize their own patterns. The stat sheet invites direct comparison between people. Friend groups will generate everyone's NPC card and argue about accuracy. The RPG visual style is eye-catching and highly shareable. The "Shop Inventory" section — showing how rarely someone gives compliments vs. how often they send memes — is the kind of brutal data visualization that makes people tag their friends.

**Data used:** Big Five personality profiles, MBTI, catchphrase detection, most-used phrases/responses, emoji vocabulary, response time (DEX), vocabulary complexity (INT), conversation dominance metrics (STR), conflict resolution style (WIS), charm/humor frequency (CHR), recurring topics and requests, message type distribution (memes vs. text vs. voice notes vs. emotional support).

## Implementation Priority Recommendation

If I had to pick the **top 3 for maximum virality**:

1. **"Twoje NPC Dialogi"** — Rides the massive NPC trend, identity-driven, highly visual, infinite replayability across different chats, low controversy risk, appeals to Gen Z gaming culture.

2. **"Twoj Chat w Sadzie"** — Controversy engine, debate generator, the mugshot card format is instantly shareable, the "charges" become social currency.

3. **"Pogrzeb Rozmowy"** — Universally relatable (everyone has dead conversations), dark humor resonates on social media, the tombstone card is peak meme format, emotional depth increases sharing.

Each of these can be implemented as a new SSE endpoint (like the existing `/api/analyze/standup`), generates a shareable card (extending the existing 16-card gallery), and uses data already computed by PodTeksT's existing quantitative + qualitative pipeline. No new parsing or data collection needed — just new prompt engineering and card design.
